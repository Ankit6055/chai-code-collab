## üå± Introduction

At ChaiCode Cohort, we use **Git** for version control and **GitHub** for collaboration. These tools enable our developers to track code changes, work together efficiently, and maintain high-quality code.

Whether you‚Äôre a Git newbie or have some experience, this guide will walk you through everything you need to know to get started.

## üåø Basics of Git and GitHub

### What is Git?
Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in your codebase. It‚Äôs widely used for managing source code and enables multiple developers to collaborate on the same project.

### What is GitHub?
GitHub is a cloud-based platform that hosts Git repositories. It provides tools for:
- Code review and collaboration.
- Issue tracking.
- Continuous integration and deployment.

## üî¢ Basic Git Commands

| Command               | Description                                |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `git status`          | Check the status of your working directory. |
| `git add <file>`      | Stage changes for the next commit.         |
| `git commit -m "msg"` | Save changes with a message.               |
| `git push`            | Push changes to the remote repository.     |
| `git pull`            | Fetch and merge changes from the remote repository. |

## üîñ Commit Message Rules

- Use the present tense (e.g., "Add feature" not "Added feature").
- Capitalize the first letter of the message.
- Keep the message under 50 characters.
- Use prefixes for categorization:
  - `feat:` for new features.
  - `fix:` for bug fixes.
  - `docs:` for documentation changes.
  - `chore:` for maintenance tasks.

### Example Messages:
```bash
feat: Add tea selection feature
fix: Resolve login issue for tea enthusiasts
docs: Update README with chai varieties
chore: Update dependencies for security patches
```

---

## üîÉ Branching Workflow

### Branching Strategy
We use the following branches:
- `main`: Production-ready code.
- `development`: Ongoing development.
- `feature/<name>`: Specific features.

### Creating and Switching Branches
```bash
git branch feature/tea-menu
git checkout feature/tea-menu
```

### Merging Branches
1. Switch to the target branch (e.g., `development`):
   ```bash
   git checkout development
   ```
2. Merge the feature branch:
   ```bash
   git merge feature/tea-menu
   ```

---

## üîÄ Pull Requests (PR)

1. Push your branch to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/tea-menu
   ```
2. Go to the GitHub repository and click **New Pull Request**.
3. Add a meaningful description and request a review.
